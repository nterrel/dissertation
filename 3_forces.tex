\section{Potential solution}
Looking for some atomistic value to use as a metric for molecular energy prediction, without actually knowing the ground truth to compare that prediction to. 

Atomic energies were a wash, there seems to be no way to reduce the predictive uncertainty of these values without making the "desired" prediction of molecular energy a higher-error prediction. 

We need something that is supported by \textit{ab initio} theory, which our networks can predict in a streamlined way in order to estimate the uncertainty of predictions at an atomistic level. There is only one quantity which exists for every atom: forces. (Could talk about dipoles here, and possibly mention how dipoles are sometimes non-existent, but the forces acting upon atoms usually aren't -- at most they are such a small value that they're considered zero -- but we don't really explore global equilibrium with MD so this shouldn't be an issue).
