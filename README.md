# Doctoral Dissertation

Based on the UF dissertation template provided by [UF IT](https://it.ufl.edu/helpdesk/graduate-resources/ms-word--latex-templates/)

This is not included in the `exampleMasterFile.tex` file, just a remnant from trying to store this locally and on GitHub -- but the compiler on my laptop creates a bunch of files that I got tired of managing and couldn't figure out how to store them all in one `build` directory. 

## Chapters (WIP)

1. Introduction

2. Atomic energies in ANI neural network potentials

3. Trends in atomic force predictions by ANI neural network potentials

4. Simulating reactive chemistry with LAMMPS-ANI

5. Analysis of organic reactions under primordial earth conditions

## File descriptions

* `ufdissertation.cls` -- don't change! This is the class file that describes the formatting. Says to only change if you know what you're doing (I don't).
