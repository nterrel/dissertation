  abstract = "The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package
              written in the Python programming language with the aim of
              setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In
              ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of
              Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to
              perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of
              calculations may be performed with the use of a simple 'for-loop'
              construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other
              quantities are performed through interfaces to many external
              electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform
              interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides
              modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as
              structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of
              constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.",
